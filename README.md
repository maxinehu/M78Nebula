This is a course project of EEL 6935: Cloud Computing and Storage (Fall 2013).1. DataProcessor:    It includes:         1) Downloader: Download weather data from ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/gsod/.                       But as of now, it only downloads all the available data collected in Gainesville,                        Florida, because the dataset is too large for us and we are not capable of dealing                       with that for the moment.        2) Decompressor: The downloaded data file are all tar/gz format, so they need to be extracted before                         we could carry out further process.        3) Predictor: It is using Support Vector Regression provided by scikit-learn. And also numpy, scipy                      and matplotlib for drawing figures. The idea of making prediction is, using data of                       the past 20 (an arbitrary value, need further research to decide) days to form train                      the model, and so that predict. The regression analysis is contained in the figure                       shown at the ending of the program.    Modules/Algorithms to be implemented in the future:        1) kNN: We are considering using kNN to make prediction more accurate.         2) Hadoop/MapReduce: Move our application onto AWS Elastic MapReduce, in order to deal with larger                             dataset and speed up the process.        3) Mammoth framework: https://github.com/zincumyx/Mammoth/wiki
